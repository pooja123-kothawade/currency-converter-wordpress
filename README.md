# Currency Converter – AJAX + jQuery + WordPress

This is a simple currency converter made using:
- WordPress (theme customization)
- AJAX for backend communication
- jQuery for frontend interaction

## How it Works

- User enters an amount and selects currencies.
- JavaScript sends data to WordPress via AJAX.
- PHP processes the conversion and returns the result.

## Files Included

- `functions.php` – handles shortcode, script loading, and AJAX
- `currency-converter.js` – AJAX and UI logic

> Built locally using XAMPP and WordPress 6.8.2
